# Metrics

I want a self hosted private place to post updates to my closest friends. These updates are important metrics that show how I am doing in life. These metrics can be anything I want, and can be tracked in a few different ways.

For example:

1. Weight
2. Salary
3. New Friends
4. Time spent watching TV
5. Drinks had

It all depends on what I am focusing on at the moment. I want to know my weight to ensure I am keeping myself healthy. But just as important for my long term goals is my financial security. I want to track my salary over time as well, to ensure that is growing too.

Anything can be tracked. When graphed, the Y Axis is auto generated, X axis is time.

# Intimate

These metrics are meant to be intimate. They will not be public. Only a few people can see them and use them to guide me. It allows people to have the quickest access into my life, to personally see how I am really doing.

Welcome.
